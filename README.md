# Visualizing BERT Embeddings on Adverse Drug Effect Detection
## Laurens Engwegen, Alessandro Palma
This is the repository of the NLP project "Visualizing BERT Embeddings on Adverse Drug Effect Detection". The scope of this work is to compare the performance of three variants of BERT model (BERT-base, BioBERT and BioClinicalBERT) on the task of Named Entity Recognition of Adverse Drug Effects on blog posts from the AskAPatient forum (https://www.askapatient.com/). After comparing the three models in terms of test set performance using different classification heads, we visualize the word embeddings of the last layer of the BERT models to define to what extent they are capable to separate different entities in the latent space.
